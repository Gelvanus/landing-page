This is my Odin Project CSS Landing page project. 
This is still very new to me, but I'm hoping that I am doing the basics right.

This Landing page is a compilation of a bunch of random content. 
This I find interesting and weird, and things of no value at all lol. 
But a lot of hard work has gone into the page and a lot of hard work is still going on.
